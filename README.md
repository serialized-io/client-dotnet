## ðŸ’¡ Getting Started

Register for a free account at https://serialized.io to get your access keys to the API (if you haven't already).

## Configuring the client

After creating a `SerializedClient` instance, you'll want to provide it with your Serialized API keys. gsProvider` instance that contains details about your project id, keys, and optionally a different root URL for Keen.IO's API.

```
using SerializedClient;
using SerializedClient.Models;
...
var client = new Serialized();
client.HttpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("Serialized-Access-Key", <your-access-key>);
client.HttpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("Serialized-Secret-Access-Key", <your-secret-access-key>);
```
